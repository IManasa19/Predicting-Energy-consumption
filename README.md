Predicting-Energy-consumption
The project aims to enhance sustainable energy management by utilizing machine learning models to accurately forecast energy usage in both residential and commercial settings. This is crucial for promoting sustainability, as precise energy forecasting can lead to more efficient consumption and better resource management.

Overview of the Project

To achieve effective forecasting, the project employs **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to streamline the data used in various machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting (GB). PCA helps reduce the number of features in the dataset, which not only simplifies the models but also boosts their computational efficiency by focusing on the most significant data points.

The analysis is based on the Smart Meters in London dataset, which contains energy usage data from over 5,567 households collected between November 2011 and February 2014. This dataset includes diverse features such as weather conditions (like temperature and humidity), time-series attributes (such as time of day and season), and various energy statistics.

Results Achieved

Among the models tested, ANN emerged as the most effective, achieving an impressive RÂ² value of 0.992, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551, and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.882. While both Gradient Boosting and XGBoost showed slightly lower accuracy, they still performed well with structured datasets, making them valuable tools for specific types of forecasting tasks.

Key Features of PCA Implementation

PCA played a pivotal role in identifying principal components that encapsulate the majority of variance within the data. By reducing dimensionality, it not only enhanced model performance but also minimized the risk of overfitting, allowing for more reliable predictions.

Applications of the Findings

The insights gained from this project can be utilized in various practical applications:
Real-time energy optimization: Adjusting energy usage dynamically based on predictive analytics.
Peak load management: Strategically planning for high-demand periods to avoid system overloads.
Resource allocation: Effectively distributing resources based on anticipated energy needs.

Future Directions

Looking ahead, the project plans to explore several avenues for improvement:
Integrating PCA with hybrid machine learning models to achieve even better prediction accuracy
Incorporating real-time data from IoT devices to enable dynamic energy forecasting.
Expanding research efforts to include energy usage patterns in industrial and transportation sectors, thereby broadening the impact of machine learning in sustainable energy management.

This project represents a significant step towards leveraging advanced technology for more sustainable energy practices, ultimately contributing to a greener future.
